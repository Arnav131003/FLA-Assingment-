# FLA Assingment ( Regular Expression to Non Deterministic Finite Automata)
This tool is designed to convert regular expressions (regex) into Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA). Regular expressions are a powerful way to describe patterns within strings, and NFAs are fundamental in the field of automata theory.

## What Are Regular Expressions?

Regular expressions are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. They are widely used for pattern matching, text validation, and text manipulation. Regex allows you to search, match, and extract data from strings based on specific patterns.

## What are NFA ?

An NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton) is a computational model used in automata theory to recognize regular languages and patterns with states that can have multiple possible transitions for the same input symbol.

# Setup and Run
